# AI-Voice-Recorder-AWS-S3
This repository contains production-grade firmware for a low-power, autonomous audio recorder based on the ESP32-S3. The device is designed for battery-powered operation, recording high-quality audio to an SD card and automatically uploading the files to any S3-compatible cloud storage service (like AWS S3, Minio, or Wasabi).
